    "#### Portability\n",
    "Kubernetes is a highly portable tool. This is due to its open-source nature and vendor agnosticism. As such, Kubernetes can be hosted on any available infrastructure, including public, private, and hybrid cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scalability\n",
    "Building for scale is a cornerstone of any modern infrastructure, enabling an application to scale based on the amount of incoming traffic. Kubernetes has in-build resources, such as HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), to determine the required amount of replicas for a service. Elasticity is a core feature that is highly automated within Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resilience\n",
    "Failure is expected on any platform. However, it is more important to be able to recover from failure fast and build a set of playbooks that minimizes the downtime of an application. Kubernetes uses functionalities like ReplicaSet, readiness, and liveness probes to handle most of the container failures, which enables powerful self-healing capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Service Discovery\n",
    "Service discovery encapsulates the ability to automatically identify and reach new services once these are available. Kubernetes provide cluster level DNS (or Domain Name System), which simplifies the accessibility of workloads within the cluster. Additionally, Kubernetes provides routing and load balancing of incoming traffic, ensuring that all requests are served without application overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extensibility\n",
    "Kubernetes is a highly extensible mechanism that uses the building-block principle. It has a set of basic resources that can be easily adjusted. Additionally, it provides a rich API interface, that can be extended to accommodate new resources or CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operational Cost\n",
    "Operational cost refers to the efficiency of resource consumption within a Kubernetes cluster, such as CPU and memory. Kubernetes has a powerful scheduling mechanism that places an application on the node with sufficient resources to ensure the successful execution of the service. As a result, most of the available infrastructure resources are allocated on-demand. Additionally, it is possible to automatically scale the size of the cluster based on the current incoming traffic. This capability is provisioned by the cluster-autoscaler, which guarantees that the cluster size is directly proportional to the traffic that it needs to handle.\n",
